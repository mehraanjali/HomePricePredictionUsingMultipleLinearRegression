# Home Price Prediction Using MultipleLinear Regression

In this small-scale project, we implement multilinear regression to predict house prices. By considering multiple factors such as area (square footage), number of bedrooms and age of the property. Our model provides accurate price estimations. This project demonstrates the power of multilinear regression for real estate analytics and serves as a hands-on example of machine learning for predicting house prices.
