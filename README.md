# Home Price Prediction Using MultipleLinear Regression

## Overview

In this small-scale project, we implement multilinear regression to predict house prices. By considering multiple factors such as area (square footage), number of bedrooms and age of the property. Our model provides accurate price estimations. This project demonstrates the power of multilinear regression for real estate analytics and serves as a hands-on example of machine learning for predicting house prices.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project, named "homeprices.csv," contains information about different homes, including their area, number of bedrooms, age, and price. The goal of this project is to build a linear regression model that can predict the price of a home based on its features.

## Results

The linear regression model successfully predicts home prices based on the provided features. The coefficients and intercept of the model are calculated to understand the impact of each feature on the predicted price.

Users can input property details, such as area, number of bedrooms, and age, to receive estimated home prices.
